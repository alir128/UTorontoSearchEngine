Comparing with Google:
======================

Our project, from the basic searching feature point of view, is quite similar to Google
search. For instance, both our App and Google can do the text search through comparing
the key words that the user inputted to the title of files or the actual content within 
the files in the database. However, there are still quite a lot of differences between 
the functions of Google search and the searching that our App can perform. Some of the 
specific differences are listed below:

## 1. Ordering Feature

**Differences:** Normally, the results of Google search will be listed in an ordering
 of the relevance to the users’ inputs. Just like Google search did, our App sets the
 relevance as the default order for the results. In addition to that, the option of
 different result ordering will also be supported in our App. For example, ordering
 results by date, by file size, and by publisher, etc. are available in our App.
 
**Users & scenario example:** For the students who want to see all the materials
 relating to one specific course, it will be easier to have an option to reorder
 the results by publisher.
 
 
## 2. Authorization Feature

**Differences:** Commonly, Google search is very like a “global search”, which is not
 possible to classify users and show different group of users with different type of
 results. In our App, the searching feature will strictly follow the accessing rights
 for different types of users. 
 
**Users & scenario example:** There are public files which can be viewed by all the
 users (even someone does not log in). There are some critical files relating to
 students’ grades will only can be viewed by certain professors or T.A.s. The course
 files of one specific course, of course, can only be viewed by students who is currently
 enrolled and the professors or T.A.s who is teaching this course. In this case, it is a
 good way to prevent sensitive files being viewed by unauthorized groups of users.
