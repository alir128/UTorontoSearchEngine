#Sprint2

We finished all the user stories in Sprint 2. We also finished all the sub-tasks. 
For Sprint 2, we basically tried to finish all of the tasks left from Sprint 1. 
In this Sprint, we came up with some problems for task arrangements. The reason 
why we have these problems is that we had many overlaps of sub-tasks in different 
user stories. But we did not have a good expectation of what problems these 
overlaps would cause at the planning stage of this sprint. These overlaps finally 
caused some redundancy of our work. We had a group call after the realization of 
these problems. And we finally had an agreement of which part of work we would 
keep as the final version. There is no rising for the actual curve because we 
focused on getting all our work done for this sprint considering the work in 
sprint 2 was the same as sprint 1.
