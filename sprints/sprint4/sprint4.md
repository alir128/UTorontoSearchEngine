#Sprint4

We have completed a lot of subtasks but only one userstory was finished in Sprint 4.
The reason is that we changed requirements in the middle of this sprint. In Friday we
had a communication with professor, accepted his advice to get rid of the Android
app part in our project and focus on optimizing the web app. We got a group call
talking about detailed information provided by professor and tried to create the
web app with better look and much more useful functions in next Sprint.
In this Sprint 4, we have done almost basic functions of a search engine, including
User Account (sign up & log in), Search (by key words) and Upload (any type of file).
Also, we built a web app demo that connect each function part together, which could
be shown on next Monday.
