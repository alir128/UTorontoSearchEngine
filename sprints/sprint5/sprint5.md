#Sprint5

We have finished most of the higher priority user stories in Sprintt 5, and are 
planning to leave writing App brief introduction and small part of User File to 
next Sprint. In this week, we completed those functions: search feature with pdf and 
html files, advanced search in different options, files' comment part, user issues 
about register, verification as well as password reset and optimization of front end.
Our communication was frequent and exchanged ideas before some hard tasks. Also, after
supporting help with each other, we got Google chats worked. This is a diagram which 
contains collections of file type distribution of searching result. And for the demo
shown next week, we had a meeting call today to discuss more details about what we
are going to demonstrate.
