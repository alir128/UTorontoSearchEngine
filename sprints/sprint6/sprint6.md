#Sprint6

We have most of tasks left from last week in Sprint 6, including fix the UI interface 
to be more official, Text Editer with auto search, implement google charts for search 
results and users, user profiles part(more options inside), create filter that could 
set files that are only visible by chosen people and give admin the high permission 
for all files. The only part we choose to complete for next Sprint is writing down the 
brief introduction of this web application and doing testing. We have discussion frequently 
and always exchange solutions idea when meeting problems. Everyone did a great work and 
got good progress.
